## GIFTASTIC ##

In this project, the user starts with a webpage that has some buttons displayed.

When the user clicks on any of the buttons, 10 gifs that are related to that button's topic will populate on the screen in a "still" format.

The user can toggle between the "still" and the "animated" format of the gif by clicking on the gif.

## More Buttons ##

On the right side of the page, there is a text input form that allows the user to create their own gif generating button.

After creating the new dynamic button, the user is able to click on that button and generate more gifs with the topic that they chose.
